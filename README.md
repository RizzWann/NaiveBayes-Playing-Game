# NaiveBayes-Playing-Game From Scratch

Na√Øve Bayes is a classification algorithm that is widely used in machine learning for various applications such as spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and document categorization. The algorithm uses the Bayes theorem to calculate the probability of a given data point belonging to a particular class, based on its features; and make assumption that all features are independent.
#### P (A | B) = P (B | A) * P (A) / P (B)
